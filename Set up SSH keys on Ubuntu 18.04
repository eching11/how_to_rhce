Set up SSH keys on Ubuntu 18.04

Basics: SSH is an encrypted protocol used to communicate with servers.
Best practices for administering a server is to disable root logins and instead use RSA key pairs.

1) Create key pair on client machine
$ ssh-keygen
# output:
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/yourhome/.ssh/id_rsa):

Press enter to accept default file location.

You may choose to enter a passphrase or leave it blank at this time.

# output:
Your identification has been saved in /yourhome/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /yourhome/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:blahsdlfaisfanblahsr6u username@remote_host
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
| ..         =    |
|  s .    ...+    |
|    s. -=    o   |
| .      ..   o   |
|      ..S   ..   |
|     o o.   ..   |
|   o.soo         |
|. . s .          |
|          = =    |

Now you have a public and private key! 



Give your server your client's public key.
$ ssh-copy-id username@remote_host
