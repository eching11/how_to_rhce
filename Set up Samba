Set up Samba file server on Ubuntu (18.04.4 LTS) to share files with Windows and macOS users.

Our system account user will be 'sour'

Install Samba on Ubuntu:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba 

Create a directory to share:
mkdir /home/sour/sambashare/

Append the following lines to Samba's config file located at /etc/samba/smb.conf
[sambashare]
	comment = Samba on Ubuntu
	path = /home/sour/sambashare
	read only = no
	browseable = yes

What it means:
comment - description of directory you're sharing
path - shared directory
read only - if no, permission to write; if yes, only read permission.
browseable - Will be listed under "Network" on users' file managers

Since we edited a config file, we need to restart the service:
sudo systemctl restart smbd
	or
sudo service smbd restart

Update the firewall rules to allow Samba traffic:
sudo ufw allow samba

Set up Samba password for our user account, sour.
sudo smbpasswd -a sour

Test it out by connecting to sambashare:
smb://ipaddress/sambashare
* ipaddress is the ip address of your Ubuntu machine.

After you successfully enter your Samba password, you'll be connected to your Ubuntu shared directory!
