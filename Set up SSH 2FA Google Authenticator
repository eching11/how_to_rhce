SSH to Ubuntu host using Google Authenticator
remote host: Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
Requirements: Google Authenticator app on iOS or Android

First, set up SSH on Ubuntu (see instructions)

On Ubuntu, install Google Authenticator.
sudo apt-get install libpam-google-authenticator

ssh into Ubuntu from the machine you'll be using (in this case I used my Mac). 

Run the following command to create a secret key:
google-authenticator

You'll be prompted to update your Google Authenticator file, type 'y'. 
A few more yes/no questions are prompted concerning security/convenience. 

Next, Google Authenticator will give you a QR code, a secret key, and emergency scratch codes.
Use either the QR code or secret key on your Google Authenticator app on your phone. 
Write down the emergency scratch codes, in the case you lose or no longer have access to your phone.

Back on your terminal, open /etc/pam.d/sshd (sudo vi /etc/pam.d/sshd) 
Add "auth required pam_google_authenticator" to the bottom of the file.

Open /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add/update the ChallengeResponseAuthentication line:
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes

Since you changed config files, restart the sshd service:
sudo systemctl restart ssh

Viola!
Next time you try to ssh into your Ubuntu machine through this machine, you'll be prompted your password AND your Google Authenticator code.
